# Snake Game
Snake Game is a classic arcade game built using Python's Turtle module. In this game, players control a snake that grows in length as it consumes food while avoiding collisions with walls and its own body.

## Installation
This game requires Python 3 and the Turtle module, which is included in the standard library.

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/itssahillwhat/Python-Projects/Snake Game.git
```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
```bash
cd Snake Game
```
3. Run the game:
```bash
python main.py
```
## Gameplay
* Use the arrow keys (Up, Down, Left, Right) to control the direction of the snake.
* The snake moves continuously in the direction it is facing.
* The objective is to eat the food (green circles) that appear on the screen to grow the snake.
* Avoid running into walls or the snake's own body, as this will end the game.
* The game ends when the snake collides with a wall or itself.
* The score is displayed at the top of the game window.
* The highest score achieved is stored and updated in the data.txt file.
