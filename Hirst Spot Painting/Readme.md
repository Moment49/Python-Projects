# Hirst Spot Painting
This project creates a simple replication of Damien Hirst's spot paintings using Python's Turtle graphics module and the Colorgram library to extract colors from an image.

## Overview
The project extracts colors from an image file named Hirst Spot.jpg and uses these colors to draw a grid of colored dots on the screen. The dots are placed in a 10x10 grid pattern with random colors chosen from the extracted color palette.

## Requirements
* Python 3.x
* Turtle Graphics (`turtle` module, included with Python)
* Colorgram library

## Installation
First, ensure you have Python 3.x installed. Then, install the Colorgram library using pip:

```shell
pip install colorgram.py
```

## Usage
1. Place an image named Hirst Spot.jpg in the same directory as the script.
2. Run the script. It will create a 10x10 grid of colored dots using colors extracted from the image.

## Notes
* The image file Hirst Spot.jpg should be placed in the same directory as the script.
* You can adjust the size of the grid, dot size, and spacing by modifying the script.


Enjoy creating your Hirst-inspired spot painting!
